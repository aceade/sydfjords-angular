# SydfjordsAngular

This is a practice project for Angular, porting [this Vue app](https://aceade.github.io/sydfjords/) to Angular.

## Running locally

Run `pnpm install` to install the packages, then `pnpm run start` to start the Angular server.

Known issues for local development:

- Images don't load.
- Sending a mock email requires a CORS addon for your browser.
